Here I solved and shared the solutions for the exercises of Google Python Class (lectured by prof. Parlante).

I didn't do the third part of the exercises (which deals with the utilities) cause at the moment I don't need to learn them.

Also, I didn't do the optional exercise (part C) from the fourth set of exercises. Couldn't understand the instructions and what exactly was required.

It is quite a good course for people who at-least have programmed before. I think that I improved my Python skills and I also finally learnt regular expressions.

The exercises are quite easy and each set of them shouldn't take more than an hour or two to solve. Still, there is a lot you can learn by doing them.
